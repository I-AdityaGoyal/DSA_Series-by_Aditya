-------------------------------------- What Are Exceptions in C++? -----------------------------------------------------

    An exception is an issue that occurs during the execution of a program, disrupting its normal flow.
    For example, trying to divide by zero or accessing invalid memory might cause exceptions.
    Without handling them, the program will terminate unexpectedly.


--------------------------------- Key Components of Exception Handling in C++: ------------------------------------------

-->> " try " Block:
        This is a block of code where you write statements that might cause an exception.
        If an exception occurs inside the try block, the program will immediately stop executing the 
        rest of the block and look for a corresponding catch block.

-->> " throw " Statement:       
        The throw keyword is used to indicate that an exception has occurred.
        You can throw various types of exceptions, such as integers, strings, or even user-defined objects.

-->> " catch " Block:
        A catch block handles the exceptions thrown by the try block.
        You can write multiple catch blocks to handle different types of exceptions


------------------------------------------- How It Works Together: --------------------------------------------------------

    1.  Code in the try block runs normally until an exception occurs.
    2.  When a throw is encountered, the program looks for a matching catch block.
    3.  The catch block processes the exception and prevents the program from crashing.
